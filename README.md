## What is OpenClaw?

[OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai/) is a personal AI assistant that actually does things. It clears your inbox, sends emails, manages your calendar, checks you in for flights, all from WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, or any chat app you already use. It runs on your machine, remembers you with persistent memory, and can browse the web, run commands, and extend itself with skills. Your data stays yours. It's open source, hackable, and built by a growing community.

## Get Started

Open `index.html` in a browser or run a local server:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Then visit http://localhost:8080
